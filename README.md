# timewarp

Simulation of moving and accelerating objects in 3+1D special relativity.

Includes interatial motion, longitudinal acceleration (general acceleration planned),
clocks and sending, receiving and recording light pulses.
Able to simulate clocks in accelerating rockets and the twin paradox.

Goal: Detecting collisions (e.g. for ladder paradox) and measuring frequency shifts.
